# Title: 
Leveraging the Naive Bayes Algorithm in Air Quality Forecasting

# Research Question:
How effective is the Naive Bayes algorithm in forecasting air quality?

# Project Overview:
This individual research initiative, conducted between January and August 2018, emerged from a deep concern for the persistent air quality issues in Beijing, China. The region faced severe air pollution challenges due to the proximity of numerous factories and extensive industrial activities. The dire state of air quality, with AQI consistently exceeding 250 and prolonged periods without seeing sunlight, had profound impacts on the well-being of the population.

Motivated by the desire to contribute to addressing this critical issue, this research project sought to merge expertise in computer science with the goal of developing an effective air quality index (AQI) forecasting system. At the time, no dedicated AQI forecasters were available, with weather forecasting being the only prevalent practice.

The culmination of this endeavor resulted in a well-structured and professionally written research paper. The paper not only presents the methodology and results but also underscores the significance of the Gaussian approach of Naive Bayes application in real-life air quality forecasting scenarios. The paper serves as a valuable experience to step into the field, providing insights into the potential of machine learning, especially using algorithms in addressing natural phenomena like predicting AQI.

# Project Highlights:
This research initiative was a comprehensive and hands-on effort that encompassed various critical phases. To begin, extensive data collection was undertaken, spanning from July 2017 to July 2018, to provide a robust foundation for the project. This involved gathering air quality data and cleaning, a crucial step in any field of data science.

Subsequently, meticulous data cleaning procedures were employed to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset. Data quality is paramount in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning model employed in this research.

The research effort extended beyond mere data analysis; it involved drawing elaborations from the findings. This process allowed for a deeper understanding of the nuances of machine learning and the factors affecting air quality.

An integral part of the research was the evaluation stage, where the model's performance was rigorously assessed. This assessment resulted in a prediction accuracy rate of 52.63%, which can be improved in future research by collecting more data and removing more variables such as confounding variables and lurking variables.
